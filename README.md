# TangDropletAnalysis

Some analysis tools written in python for extacting frames and features from videos of droplets entering a constriction. Note the current code is for already preprocessed, binary videos. See the *write_all_frames_to_dictionary.py* code for notes on setting up your working directory and *example_code.py* for some examples on implementation of methods.

## Just some figures...

### Stay tuned for code to preprocess videos and more!
